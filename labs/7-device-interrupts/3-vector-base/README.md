### Setting vector base

You'll write the inline assembly to set the vector base.  See:
  - 3-121 in `../../docs/arm1176.pdf`

What to do:
  - You only have to modify `vector-base.h`
  - There are two tests (you have to modify the makefile to run each).
  - When the tests pass, move the `vector-base.h` file to `libpi/src` and make
    sure they still work.
